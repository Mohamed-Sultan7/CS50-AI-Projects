# Analysis

## Layer 5, Head 7

This attention head seems to highlight the relationship between **pronouns and their corresponding verbs**. For example, in sentences where “he” or “I” are used, the head directs strong attention from the pronoun to the action they perform. This suggests the head is helping the model understand subject-verb agreement or role assignment in the sentence.

Example Sentences:
- I picked up the book from the table.
- He smiled at the strange painting.

## Layer 9, Head 3

This head focuses on **prepositions and the nouns they introduce**. The attention pattern often links words like “on”, “in”, or “to” with the objects that follow, which likely helps BERT understand spatial or directional relationships in sentences.

Example Sentences:
- She sat on the red armchair.
- We walked through the door to the other room.
