# CS50 AI Projects
By [Mohamed Sultan](https://hamody.dev)

This repository contains my completed assignments from Harvard's **CS50's Introduction to Artificial Intelligence with Python (CS50 AI)**
Each project applies AI techniques like search, logic, probability, natural language processing, and machine learning.
